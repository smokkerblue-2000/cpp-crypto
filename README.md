## C++ Market Data Processor for Crypto Ecxhanges

[Download here](https://github.com/smokkerblue-2000/cpp-crypto/releases)

This repository in written in C++ to connect to crypto exchanges.

It runs in a linux enviornment via Docker.

The first exchange is Binance bookTicker Channel.

All development has been done on a **MacBook** by running a **Docker** containter which contains the Linux env.  The choice was made to develop in a Docker Container because most people just carry around laptops and its cheaper to Develop locally on a Laptop inside of a Docker Linux Container than to run Linux on a cloud computing machine.  All that is required is a Docker subscripton to get going.  if you already have a Linux enviornment and don't want to use Docker that works too.

The code is compiled and run in Linux with the Linux shell running locally on a Mac by:

- Creating a Linux-based Docker image (e.g., Ubuntu)
- Running the container on macOS using Docker
- Mounting your macOS file system into the container using volumes

This setup enables fully containerized C++ development that integrates seamlessly with local file editing.

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### 1. Build the Docker container

***Run on Mac (should also work on Linux or Windows)***

Docker is cross platform so building the Docker image should work on most OS.  It was only tested on ***MacBook***

This builds an Ubuntu-based image with all dependencies (e.g., CMake, OpenSSL, IXWebSocket):

```sh
./run-build-linux-docker.sh
```

### 2. Start the Linux Shell

Run the Docker Image, creates a shell to do development in

***start this on your MacBook***

```sh
# run the docker image
# specify the mount point
# this will be where r/w access between mac/docker will be

./run-linux-docker.sh $HOME/cpp-crypto 
```


### 3. Build IXWebSocket

***Done in linux*** 

clone the IXWebSocket repo

USE_TLS=TRUE

install headers and lib

```sh
# start the linux shell but running the docker image
./run-linux-docker.sh $HOME/cpp-crypto
```
***inside the linux shell run the following***
 
```sh
# installs headers to /workspace/install/include
# installs lib     to /workspace/install/lib


./run-build-ixwebsocket.sh
```


### 4. Build book-ticker-test

***Done in linux*** 

This connects to bookTicker on binance and listens to btcusdt

This version is just a simple websocket connection that prints out the exact json message coming from binance bookTicker

```sh
# start the linux shell but running the docker image
./run-linux-docker.sh $HOME/cpp-crypto
```
***inside the linux shell run the following***

```sh
cd book-ticker-test
./run-build.sh
./build/main  # you will immediately see a stream of data if it works 
```
### 5. Build simdjson , the fast json parser

***Done in linux*** 

***inside the linux shell run the following***
 
```sh
# installs headers to /workspace/install/include
# installs lib     to /workspace/install/lib


./run-build-simd.sh
```
